#+Title: Can Pluralism give a satisfactory solution to the foundational crisis in mathematics?

[[../screenshots/reuben-pluralism.png]]

Realism suggests there exist abstract mathematical objects. With the addition that these objects are independent of human interaction, this view becomes platonism.

1. Human beings exist entirely within space and time
2. If abstract objects exist, then they do not exist within space and time
3. If both are true, humans could not have knowledge of them
