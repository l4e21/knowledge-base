#+Title: Computer in Chess: Solving Inexact Search Problems

A task is inexact if it solves via a minimax procedure on a truncated search tree.
A depth-truncated tree is one which is not exhaustively searched.
A tree will grow exponentially with depth.

One thing we might do is select from 'candidate moves' based on positional features, which is something skilled players actually do in games.

We can also choose to search less deep, having a limiting number.
Problems with breaking off search numerically is obviously we might break it off not for logical reasons but by compulsion.
Also, sometimes moves that seem illogical can be good for specific reasons (every position is different).
